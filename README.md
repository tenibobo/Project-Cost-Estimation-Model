# Project-Cost-Estimation-Model
This is a cost estimation model for a steel pressure vessel. Tis was created solely by using excel
but python could be another suitable means. Thee dataset is not big enough to justify the quality of
the model but it works well enough after giving some cost engineering considerations and giving less focus to 
statistics
